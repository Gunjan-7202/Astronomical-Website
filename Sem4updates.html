                <h1 style="color:brown">China's Mars rover Zhurong is hunkering down for its 1st Red Planet winter</h1> 
                <p>China's Zhurong Mars rover is adjusting to its first winter on the Red Planet while its companion orbiter continues to map the world from above.
                    Zhurong, part of China's Tianwen-1 mission, has been operating in the vast basin of Utopia Planitia for 347 Martian days, or sols, and has traveled 6,302 feet (1,921 meters) across the planet's surface, according to a May 6 update posted by the Chinese Lunar Exploration Program.
                    However, the rover is now receiving lower amounts of energy from the sun as winter takes hold in Mars' northern hemisphere.<br>
                    Zhurong has an automated sleep mode which will kick in if energy levels fall below a set point, triggering hibernation until environmental conditions improve. The coldest period for Zhurong is expected to occur in July.
                    But for now, the rover's work continues. A new image from Zhurong's navigation and terrain camera reveals rocks disturbed by a meteor impact.Meanwhile, in orbit, the Tianwen 1 spacecraft that carried Zhurong on the seven-month journey from Earth to Mars has continued its work from above. 
                    To compensate, the Zhurong engineering team has adjusted the angle of the solar wings for maximum sun exposure and reduced the working hours of the spacecraft to control its energy usage.

                <h1 style="color:brown">Mars Water </h1> 
                <p>Evidence is growing that Mars, now cold and dry, had liquid water running on its surface much more recently than previously thought.
                    Scientists have long believed that Mars was wet around 3 billion years ago, during the planet's Hesperian period, then lost much of its water. But the a new study presents evidence of water activity from just 700 million years ago, well into the current Amazonian period, posing a new puzzle to crack about the Red Planet and its history.
                    The new study is based on data from China's Zhurong rover, which is part of the Tianwen-1 mission and touched down on the surface of Mars in May 2021. In particular, the scientists used data the rover gathered during its first 92 Martian days, or sols, at its landing site in Utopia Planitia. Yang Liu, a researcher at the National Space Science Center (NSSC) under the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), and colleagues analyzed data from three different instruments on Zhurong: the laser-induced breakdown spectrometer (MarSCoDe), the telescopic microimaging camera and the short-wave infrared spectrometer.
                    NASA has sent its Mars rovers to ancient landing sites, dating back to the Noachian age more than 3.7 billion years ago. Zhurong, then, is not just an extra set of wheels on Mars, but a powerful suite of instruments exploring a new, geologically young site to open new windows of opportunity for research on Mars.

                <h1 style="color:brown">SpaceX's Crew-3 astronauts dish on their action-packed 6 months in orbit</h1>
                <p>From dodging space debris to welcoming the first-ever fully private astronaut mission to the International Space Station, SpaceX's Crew-3 mission had a very eventful six months off Earth.
                    Crew-3 docked with the International Space Station (ISS) on Nov. 11, and the mission's four astronauts witnessed a rapidly changing space environment almost from the moment they arrived. For example, a Russian anti-satellite test on Nov. 16 created a cloud of debris that soon forced the astronauts to shelter in their SpaceX Dragon capsule Endurance as a precaution.
                    "Scared would be the wrong word" to describe how the crew felt in those minutes, Crew-3 pilot and veteran NASA astronaut Tom Marshburn told reporters during a livestreamed press conference Wednesday (May 11). He was speaking five days after his safe splashdown off the coast of Tampa, Florida, with fellow NASA astronauts Raja Chari and Kayla Barron and the European Space Agency's Matthias Maurer.
                    "I think 'acting with a purpose' — that's what we were doing," Marshburn said of the crew's activities during their "shelter in place" procedures. "But even from the very first call we got from the ground," he added, "it was pretty much like we trained. I was like, 'OK, here's the way you need to have this procedure.'"

            <h1 style="color:brown">Stronger gravity in the early universe may solve a cosmological conundrum</h1>
            <p>The inflationary epoch that caused our universe to rapidly expand in its earliest moments may be connected to the modern era of dark energy, thanks to a phantom component of the cosmos that changes the strength of gravity as the universe evolves, a physicist proposes in a new paper.
                In this model, described in a paper published in the preprint database arXiv, the scalar field part of the scalar-tensor theory (the "tensor" refers to space-time itself) is a lot stronger in the early universe, thereby triggering the epoch of inflation. At the end of inflation, the scalar field weakens and releases its energy in the form of all the particles of the Standard Model (like quarks and electrons).
                Crucially, the scalar field never goes away. It maintains some background presence as the universe continues to evolve, forming stars and galaxies in the meantime. Then, after cosmic expansion dilutes all the matter to a low enough level, the scalar field kicks in again — but at a much weaker level — giving rise to the current era of dark energy

        <p>Earth’s satellite experiences 85 minutes of totality and Mars meets Neptune in the sky from May 13 to 20.Enjoy Friday the 13th with an object pulled from Astronomy columnist Stephen James O’Meara’s Ghost Hunt. Although this fun challenge is meant for the Halloween season, plenty of objects on the list are visible in the springtime sky as well. Tonight, the light of the Moon will wash out many fainter targets, but NGC 457 is a 6th-magnitude open cluster in Cassiopeia still visible for those with a telescope.
            NGC 457 is also called the Owl Cluster or the E.T. Cluster (among many other names) because its stars form the shape of an owl with its wings spread in flight — or, for those who want that slightly spookier vibe, 
            a familiar Spielberg alien with his arms outstretched.he cluster sits just over 2° due south of Ruchbah (Delta [δ] Cassiopeiae), the second star from the left in and the leftmost dip in the Queen’s “w” when seen right-side-up. You’ll notice two brighter stars amid a smattering of fainter ones — those bright stars are the figure’s eyes, which can guide you to find the rest of the body, stretching to the northwest. Overall, NGC 457 is home to some two dozen stars brighter than 12th magnitu
